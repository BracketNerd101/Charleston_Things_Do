        <p class="lead">What is Rainbow Row?

          Rainbow Row refers to the row of pastel-colored historic homes located on East Bay Street, just along the Battery. As one of Charlestonâ€™s most iconic sites, you can visit this area on any given day and see couples getting their photos taken for engagements or weddings, along with a drove of tourists trying to get a good photograph of the stunning houses. <br>

          Though the row of vibrant Georgian houses is beautiful, they attract visitors for more than just their aesthetic charm. As with most historic buildings in the Holy City, these special homes have their own fascinating story to tell.</p>
